## AirBnB clone - Web static

### Descriptions
* This is one phase of the Airbnb Clone: the HTML and CSS part.
* The Images folder holds icons for the site (e.g. logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, guest icons).
* The Styles folder holds CSS styling files. The largest numbered style file of each category (e.g. common, footer, header, places) is most relevant to the finished product.
* The highlest numbered index.html file is likewise the most relevant to the finished product.
